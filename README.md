# 🧠 Telco Customer Churn Prediction

This project analyzes customer data from a telecom company to predict **customer churn** — that is, whether a customer will leave the service or not.  
It uses **machine learning models** to identify patterns that lead to customer retention or churn.

## 🎯 Objective

To develop a machine learning model that predicts customer churn based on demographics, account details, and service usage.

## 📊 Dataset

- **File:** `WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv` *(ignored in GitHub via .gitignore)*
- **Source:** IBM Sample Dataset
- **Description:** Includes features like customer tenure, monthly charges, contract type, payment method, and churn status.

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas, NumPy** – Data processing
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning models

## 🔍 Workflow

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**  
   Handle missing values, convert data types, and prepare features.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Visualize customer trends and churn rates using charts and correlations.  

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   Encode categorical variables, normalize numerical features.  

4. **Model Training**  
   Apply models like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.  

5. **Model Evaluation**  
   Compare models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

## 📈 Results

- The model identifies key churn indicators such as **contract type**, **tenure**, and **monthly charges**.  
- Achieved strong performance with optimized model parameters.

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Implement ensemble models (XGBoost, LightGBM).  
- Deploy model as a web app using **Flask** or **Streamlit**.  
- Integrate real-time churn prediction dashboard.
